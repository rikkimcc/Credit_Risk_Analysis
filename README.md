# Credit_Risk_Analysis


In this analysis, I was to create a supervised machine learning model that could accurately predict credit risk. 

6 different methods were used:

1. Naive Random Oversampling
2. SMOTE Oversampling
3. Cluster Centroid Undersampling
4. SMOTEENN Sampling
5. Balanced Random Forest Classifying
6. Easy Ensemble Classifying
