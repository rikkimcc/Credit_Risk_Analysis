# Credit_Risk_Analysis


In this analysis, I was to create a supervised machine learning model that could accurately predict credit risk. 

6 different methods were used:

Naive Random Oversampling
SMOTE Oversampling
Cluster Centroid Undersampling
SMOTEENN Sampling
Balanced Random Forest Classifying
Easy Ensemble Classifying
